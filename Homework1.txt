## Landscape:

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	Before mint, there were several separate budgeting apps. Quicken, microsoft money to manage personal and business income. No automatic categorization, yellow pages was used to identify the different transactions and their locations. Since then, we've seen automatic linking of multiple accounts into a single location for users to identify, categorize, and budget their transactions. Apps like YNAB allow users to follow a specific budgeting methodolgy to manage money. Mint is arguably the watershed app for personal finance, online wealth management, and possibly POS payment apps. (Source, my balls)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
	# Users, paid vs free (guess), Traffic to site (quora interview), #EEs

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
	Mint is currently the top, and the largest, based on web traffic data, although they are shrinking. (crunchbase). YNAB is the next closest, followed by Personal Capital, and with Tiller in the rear. 

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
Keep the app lightweight (complaint about it being too rigid)
	1. Provide financial and investment advice to users. 
	2. Find a way to control user's spending. Everything at this point is on the reactive end. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	1. Apps like Robinhood have revolutionized the ability for users to make investments on their own by lowering the barriers to entry for those that aren't educated in stocks. Private capital is already performing the advice portion. Combining the two from the mint user's budget will incentivize new users and keep existing ones. 
	2. I can set budgets all day, but sticking to them is another story.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
